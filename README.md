# hello-world
My name is Zephyr Davenport. As of September 2018, I am 21 years old. I'm in college and taking seperate online courses in order to be able to efficiently use the languages C# and C++, properly use the Unity and Unreal engine and create websites using CSS and HTML.

I want to eventually create my own software and games one day. Until then, I plan on learning what I can so I can support myself.

Nice to meet you.
